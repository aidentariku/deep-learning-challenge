# Deep Learning Model for Alphabet Soup

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can predict whether organizations funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful based on various features provided in the dataset. By training a neural network on historical data, the goal is to create a binary classifier that can assist Alphabet Soup in identifying potential successful applicants for funding.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Target variable(s):** The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL", which indicates whether the funding provided to an organization was used effectively (1) or not (0).
- **Feature variable(s):** The feature variables for the model include various metadata about each organization, such as "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", and "ASK_AMT".
- **Variable(s) removed:** The variables "EIN" and "NAME" were removed from the input data as they are identification columns and do not contribute to the predictive power of the model.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- **Neurons, layers, and activation functions:** 
  - The neural network model consisted of two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons, respectively, and utilized the ReLU activation function. 
  - The output layer used the sigmoid activation function.
- **Achievement of target model performance:** 
  - The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.61% on the test dataset, which may be considered satisfactory depending on the specific requirements and context of the application.
- **Steps taken to increase model performance:** 
  - Adjustments to the number of neurons and layers were made to find a balance between model complexity and performance.
  - Various activation functions were tested to identify the most suitable options for the hidden layers.
  - Different optimization algorithms and learning rates were experimented with to improve convergence and reduce loss.

## Summary
In summary, the deep learning model developed for Alphabet Soup showed moderate performance with an accuracy of approximately 72.61% on the test dataset. While the model may provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of funding for organizations, further optimizations and enhancements could be explored to improve its performance. Additionally, incorporating additional data sources or features, refining preprocessing techniques, and experimenting with alternative architectures could lead to better predictive performance.

## How to Use
To use the trained model:
1. Install the necessary dependencies (`tensorflow`, `pandas`, etc.).
2. Load the model from the saved HDF5 file using `tf.keras.models.load_model`.
3. Preprocess your data using the same preprocessing steps as in the training phase.
4. Make predictions using the `predict` method of the loaded model.
